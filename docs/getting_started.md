## Introduction

Let's assume we live in a kleptocracy where you cannot be sure whether the land you have bought 20 years ago is still registered on your name or if some corrupt politician has changed the official record and claimed your land.

Nowadays, we just trust our governments to not tamper with our record; this is fine for now but it raises the quesiton fi there isn't a better solution to our problem. What if there exists a method writing something down, that cannot be changed in the future? Using CreoChain we can do just that.

## Installing CreoChain on a server

It is reccomended that you use a linux server (We are going to use CentOS 7).
